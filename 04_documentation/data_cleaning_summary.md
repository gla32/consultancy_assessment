# Data Cleaning and Merging Summary

**Date:** 2025-01-27  
**Script:** `03_scripts/data_preparation/02_clean_merge_data.py` and `02_clean_merge_data.ipynb`

## Overview

Successfully created and executed a comprehensive data cleaning and merging script that combines three datasets into a single analysis-ready file.

## Key Accomplishments

### 1. UNICEF Data Cleaning ✅
- **Filtered for years 2018-2022** as required
- **Extracted ANC4 and SBA indicators** based on exploration findings
- **Kept most recent estimate** for each country-indicator combination
- **Converted to wide format** with ANC4 and SBA as separate columns
- **Result:** 222 countries processed → 171 individual countries after filtering

### 2. Population Data Cleaning ✅
- **Extracted 2022 birth projections** from WPP2022 file
- **Handled complex file structure** (header at row 16)
- **Converted to numeric format** with proper error handling
- **Handled missing values** appropriately
- **Result:** 285 countries processed → 240 individual countries after filtering

### 3. Mortality Classification Cleaning ✅
- **Created binary classification** as required:
  - **On-track:** "achieved" or "on-track" status (134 countries)
  - **Off-track:** "acceleration needed" status (66 countries)
- **Result:** 200 countries processed → 198 individual countries after filtering

### 4. Country Name Standardization ✅
- **Created comprehensive mapping** for 29 common country name variations
- **Applied consistent naming** across all datasets
- **Filtered out regional aggregates** using 40+ pattern rules
- **Standardized encoding and whitespace** handling

### 5. Dataset Merging ✅
- **Used inner joins** to keep only countries with complete data
- **Validated merge results** with comprehensive statistics
- **Final merged dataset:** 152 countries with complete data across all sources

## Final Dataset Characteristics

### Dataset Structure
- **Shape:** 152 rows × 6 columns
- **Countries:** 152 individual countries (no regional aggregates)
- **File:** `02_processed_data/merged_health_data.csv`

### Variables
1. **Country** - Standardized country names
2. **ISO3Code** - 3-letter country codes
3. **Mortality_Status_Binary** - Binary classification (on-track/off-track)
4. **ANC4** - Antenatal care 4+ visits coverage (%)
5. **SBA** - Skilled birth attendance coverage (%)
6. **Births_2022** - 2022 birth projections (thousands)

### Data Completeness
- **ANC4 data:** 86 countries (56.6% coverage)
- **SBA data:** 149 countries (98.0% coverage)
- **Birth data:** 152 countries (100% coverage)
- **Mortality status:** 152 countries (100% coverage)

### Key Statistics
- **ANC4 coverage:** Mean 72.7% (range: 24.4% - 99.9%)
- **SBA coverage:** Mean 91.2% (range: 31.9% - 100%)
- **Mortality status distribution:**
  - On-track: 102 countries (67.1%)
  - Off-track: 50 countries (32.9%)

## Data Quality Improvements

### Country Name Standardization
- Resolved naming inconsistencies across datasets
- Mapped common variations (e.g., "USA" → "United States")
- Handled special characters and encoding issues

### Regional Filtering
- Removed 51 regional aggregates from UNICEF data
- Removed 45 regional aggregates from population data
- Removed 2 regional aggregates from mortality data
- Ensured analysis focuses on individual countries only

### Missing Data Handling
- ANC4: 43.4% missing (expected due to data availability)
- SBA: Only 2.0% missing (excellent coverage)
- Population data: Complete coverage after cleaning
- Mortality status: Complete coverage

## Technical Implementation

### Script Features
- **Modular design** with separate functions for each cleaning step
- **Comprehensive error handling** and validation
- **Detailed logging** of all processing steps
- **Flexible country mapping** system
- **Robust regional filtering** with pattern matching

### Files Created
1. **Python script:** `03_scripts/data_preparation/02_clean_merge_data.py`
2. **Jupyter notebook:** `03_scripts/data_preparation/02_clean_merge_data.ipynb`
3. **Final dataset:** `02_processed_data/merged_health_data.csv`

## Validation Results

### Merge Success
- Successfully merged all three datasets
- Maintained data integrity throughout the process
- No duplicate countries in final dataset
- All required variables present

### Data Quality Checks
- ✅ No invalid country names
- ✅ Numeric data properly formatted
- ✅ Binary classification correctly applied
- ✅ Missing values appropriately handled
- ✅ File structure validated

## Next Steps

The cleaned and merged dataset is now ready for:
1. **Statistical analysis** of health coverage patterns
2. **Comparison analysis** between on-track and off-track countries
3. **Visualization** of health indicator distributions
4. **Correlation analysis** between indicators and mortality status

## Sample Countries by Status

### On-track Countries (102 total)
- Albania, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Canada, Chile, etc.

### Off-track Countries (50 total)
- Afghanistan, Benin, Burkina Faso, Bangladesh, Cameroon, etc.

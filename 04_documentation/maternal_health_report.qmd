## Results Interpretation

The analysis reveals significant maternal health coverage gaps between countries on-track and off-track to meet SDG 3.1 targets. Population-weighted coverage shows a `{python} f"{stats['anc4_gap']:.1f}"` percentage point gap for antenatal care (ANC4+) and a `{python} f"{stats['sba_gap']:.1f}"` percentage point gap for skilled birth attendance (SBA). On-track countries achieve `{python} f"{stats['anc4_on_track']:.1f}"`% ANC4+ coverage compared to `{python} f"{stats['anc4_off_track']:.1f}"`% in off-track countries, while SBA coverage is `{python} f"{stats['sba_on_track']:.1f}"`% versus `{python} f"{stats['sba_off_track']:.1f}"`% respectively.

**Key Caveats and Assumptions:** This analysis is based on population-weighted averages using 2022 birth data, which may mask within-country variations and assumes uniform coverage distribution within countries. Coverage data availability varies between indicators (ANC4+ data for 86 countries, SBA data for 149 countries), potentially introducing selection bias. The analysis reflects service utilization rather than quality of care, and country classifications as "on-track" or "off-track" are based on maternal mortality projections that may not capture recent policy changes or improvements. Additionally, the temporal alignment between coverage data (2018-2022) and demographic projections introduces uncertainty, and the analysis does not account for subnational disparities or social determinants that significantly influence access to maternal health services.
